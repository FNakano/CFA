# Big Mess (in my mind)

Previous in [watchFace.md](./watchFace.md)

I belive I have all the necessary elements to build the watch application but they are too many. I would get lost if I just start programming.

## Requisites

1. Show date and time first (DTScreen);
2. In DTScreen some shortcuts to my activity log;
3. In DTScreen a button to activity log app;
4. In DTScreen a button to the "next screen"
5. A screen to set date/time
  - Try to automatically adjust date/time when connected to USB;
    - how to know a data connection is available?
6. A screen to activate ESP.AP and WebREPL
7. A screen to show battery status
8. A screen to show temperature
9. A screen to set wakeup/sleep interval
10. A screen to set alarms
11. A screen to chronometer/timer
12. Upload/download of logged data is provided by Micropython/Thonny
