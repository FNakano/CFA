# Frameworks to Web Servers

There is a variety of frameworks to help implement web servers in Micropython. One can even build his(her) own one, or, just build a web server directly using sockets.

Each framework (and other build approaches) have its characteristics.

I intend to list some frameworks and its relevant (to me) features. Features were compiled in 2024-Sep. I just grabbed information from the sites. I didn't test them on devices.

Early discussions in Micropython forum: https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?t=7058

It looks like, by 2022, there was not known async functions to make client requests (https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?t=11895) but there existed a library: https://github.com/StevenRuest/async_urequests (I just forked it...)

There is a modified Micropython version with async requests: https://software.open-dev.ru/docs/online/micropython/library/arequests.html - it is from a development company in russia.
